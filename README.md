# Drone Remote ID to Meshtastic with Mesh-Mapper API - Bleeding Edge Dev 📡

## About

***Minimal WiFi & BT 4/5 Drone Remote ID Scanner***

- This project is a minimal scanner for WiFi and BT-based Drone Remote ID based on Cemaxacuter's [wifi remote id detection firmware](https://github.com/alphafox02/T-Halow), using OpenDroneID. 

- Runs on an ESP32 (defined with Xiao ESP32-C3 and S3 variants) and sends parsed messages over a custom UART to a serial mesh network as well as serial JSON logging.

## Features 🌟

- **WiFi Monitoring:** Listens to WiFi management frames in promiscuous mode to capture Drone Remote ID packets.
- **BT 4/5 Monitoring**: Listens for advertisements to capture Drone Remote ID packets in real time *(S3 dualcore fw only)*
- **Protocol Support:** Decodes messages from **OpenDroneID** format.
- **Mesh Integration:** Uses UART to send compact, formatted messages to a mesh network.
- **Real-Time Mapping:** Provides a web-based interface built with the Mesh-Mapper API that:
  - Displays drone and pilot positions on a map using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap tiles.
  - Tracks movement paths automatically with unique color markers (derived from device MAC addresses).
  - Offers intuitive controls such as alias management, locking onto markers, and color customization.
- **Stale Data Management:** Automatically removes markers and paths if no new data is received within 5 minutes.
- **Logging & Export:** Prints JSON to serial with heartbeat monitor. Saves each detection to a CSV file and continuously updates a KML file for offline analysis.
- **Serial Port Selection:** Presents a user-friendly interface to select the correct USB serial port for ESP32 connection.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **ESP32 Firmware:**
   - **Initialization:**  
     - Configures USB Serial (115200 baud) for JSON output and Serial1 for mesh messaging.
     - Sets WiFi to promiscuous mode on a predefined channel (e.g., channel 6).
   - **Data Capture & Parsing:**  
     - Listens for WiFi management frames and decodes Drone Remote ID packets.
     - Formats the data into a minimal JSON payload including:
       - `mac`: The device MAC address.
       - `rssi`: Signal strength.
       - `drone_lat`, `drone_long`, `drone_altitude`: Drone’s GPS data.
       - `pilot_lat`, `pilot_long`: Pilot’s location data.
       - `basic_id`: A unique identifier or Remote ID.
   - **Data Transmission:**  
     - Sends the JSON payload over USB Serial to a computer running the Flask API.
     - Sends formatted messages via UART (mesh messages) to integrate with mesh networks.

2. **Flask API & Mapping Interface:**
   - **Serial Port Management:**  
     - On start, prompts the user to select the USB serial port where the ESP32 is connected.
   - **Data Handling & Logging:**  
     - Receives and parses JSON data from the ESP32.
     - Remaps keys for consistency and logs each detection to a CSV file with a timestamped filename.
     - Continuously regenerates a KML file to visualize drone and pilot trajectories.
   - **Real-Time Map Visualization:**  
     - The web-based mapping interface polls the API regularly to update marker positions.
     - Displays markers for drones (🛸) and pilots (👤) and dynamically draws movement paths.
     - Incorporates user-friendly controls for locking onto specific markers, setting aliases, and adjusting colors.
   - **Mesh-Mapper Integration:**  
     - The mapping program, Mesh-Mapper, unifies real-time locations with historical data and interactive controls to enhance user experience.

## How to Connect and Map 🚀

1. **Connect Your ESP32:**
   - Flash the provided firmware onto your ESP32 (compatible with boards like the Xiao ESP32-S3).
   - Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB.

2. **Start the Flask API:**
   - Run the Python Flask API script.
   - Open your web browser to view the interactive map and control panel.

3. **Select Your Serial Port:**
   - The web interface will prompt you to select the correct USB serial port (corresponding to your ESP32 connection).
   - Click "Select Port" to continue.

4. **View the Map:**
   - After port selection, the map displays:
     - Real-time markers for drones and pilots.
     - Continuously updated movement paths.
     - Options to lock onto devices and adjust marker settings.
   - The interface refreshes frequently to ensure live updates.
   - Markers and paths are removed automatically if no valid data is received for more than 5 minutes.

## API Endpoints & Usage 🚀

The Flask API provides several endpoints:

- **GET `/api/detections`:**  
  Retrieves current detection data in JSON format for updating the map.

- **POST `/api/detections`:**  
  Accepts new detection data (from the ESP32 or for testing) and logs it.

- **GET `/api/detections_history`:**  
  Provides historical detection data in GeoJSON format for mapping.

- **GET `/api/aliases`:**  
  Returns device alias mappings stored on the server.

- **POST `/api/set_alias`:**  
  Allows setting a custom alias for a given device (by MAC address).

- **POST `/api/clear_alias/<mac>`:**  
  Clears a previously set alias for a device.

- **GET `/api/serial_status`:**  
  Indicates whether the USB serial connection is active.

- **GET `/api/paths`:**  
  Retrieves saved drone and pilot paths for persistent mapping.

## Drone Remote ID Firmware (ESP32) Overview 🛠️

The ESP32 firmware is the heart of the wireless scanning operation:
- **WiFi Scanning:**  
  Captures WiFi management frames in promiscuous mode.
- **Data Parsing:**  
  Decodes Drone Remote ID messages using both direct and NAN (Neighbor Awareness Networking) techniques.
- **Message Transmission:**  
  - **USB JSON Output:** Sends a minimal JSON payload (containing fields like `mac`, `rssi`, GPS coordinates, and `basic_id`) over USB to the Flask API.
  - **Mesh Messaging via UART:** Sends compact, human-readable messages to a mesh network, facilitating additional integration or display options.
- **Dual Transmission Modes:**  
  - **Standard JSON Transmission:** For regular updates.
  - **Fast JSON Transmission:** For high-frequency detections, ensuring data is as real-time as possible.
